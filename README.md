# Library App

Learning about prototypal inheritance and object creation in Javascript, it can store page number,
author and whether or not it's been read. 

## How it works

When the form is filled, the info submitted by the user is taken by the form and a new object is
created in an array based on the object constructor. 

The new object is then used and put into the applicable fields in the "cards". 

The "toggling" of whether or not the book has been read is a function which is created outside of
the object constructor and instead is written when the button is created.
